# Introduction
dckcdklc We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa

particle size was measured using a PCAS (Blogg et al 2004)
clkdjc kcnmcopsa
Jones et al (1998)
A large uncertanodsndjdstiey in modeling BBOA is the extent to wich measurements in the literature can be applied at a regonal

#Methdology

Methods section

#Simulation
This is the simulation part


# Results
The simulations indicate that coagulation is the dominant growth
mechanism for these particles.


# Figures
Figures go in their own section in a draft paper.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the BBOA aging process. 
Nonetheless, questions remain unanswered, so we should get some more funding.

# Acknowledgements
We would like to thank our EU funding body for their support.
